# Rust Meta-Programming Lab

Experiments with meta-programming in Rust.

We explore a common topic in business applications - the need to model data and build user interfaces to display them.

We create a meta-language to hold this and generate the back-end (Rust) data structures and
associated meta-model for exporting to the client for creating sufficient (but perhaps not super elegant) user interfaces
for that data.
